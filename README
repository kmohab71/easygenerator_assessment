## Start Script

The following command is used to build and start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file in detached mode:

- `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d`

### Explanation:
- `-f docker-compose.yml`: Specifies the Docker Compose file to use.
- `up`: Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service.
- `--build`: Forces the build of images before starting the containers.
- `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

This command is typically used to initialize and run the application stack defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
